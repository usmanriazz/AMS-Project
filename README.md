# AMS-Project
Academic Management System (AMS) is a C++ project that allows efficient management of academic data. It includes two types of users: Admin and Student. The Admin can add, view, and manage student records, including marks and personal information. Students can log in to view their details and results. 
This project is new slate console based

  <h1>Additional key Function</h1>

  Our project is a server based Academic Management System (AMS), which is
 intended to offer real time, role-based access control over different devices
 through Google Drive cloud synchronization. Say changing the passwords, the
 attendance or the entries in the grades are made on any one of the authorised
 devices, then they reflect on each of the connected PCs instantaneously, in a
 manner that is uniform and smooth. Administrators can assign access roles to
 any device respectively so as to allow for customized permissions to faculty,
 students or staff while at the same improving centralize control. Designed in
 C++ with backings from Google Drive  for storage in the cloud, the system
 ensures data consistency, security, and availability from any authorized
 workstation. This architecture does not allow version conflicts, maximizes
 collaboration, and minimizes the dependency on physical servers â€“ it is an
 efficient, scalable and cost effective solution to the traditional AMS solution.

   <h1>Future Improvments</h1>

 Our Project though have some cons of its own but it is future compatible and
 can further be upgraded with new technologies . Some improvements are
 Database Integration: Replace text files with a database (SQLite/MySQL)
 for better scalability
 Notifications for low attendance or poor performance
 Enhanced Security: Implement password encryption instead of plaintext
 storage
 Automated Reporting & Analytics

  <h1>DrawBacks</h1>

   The only draw back of this project is that system is confined to only 4 students
 on the contrast it is expandable to multiple students . The decision of confining
 this project to only 4 students is made after discussion with team members. It
 will also easy for us to show and explain  and implement the project as we are
 not confined to handle a lot student data
